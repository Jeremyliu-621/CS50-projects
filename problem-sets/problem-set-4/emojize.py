"""

Because emoji aren‚Äôt quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support ‚Äúcodes,‚Äù 
whereby you can type, for instance, :thumbs_up:, which will be automatically converted to üëç. Some programs 
additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, :thumbsup:, which will also be 
automatically converted to üëç.

In a file called emojize.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the 
‚Äúemojized‚Äù version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.
