"""

When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, 
as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file 
called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and 
then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether 
inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
